It answers the question what an object does rather than how it does it, and in Python it is commonly achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. On the other hand, encapsulation is concerned with binding data and methods together into a single unit and restricting direct access to some of the object’s components. It answers the question how data is protected, and in Python it is achieved using classes and access modifiers like private variables (using double underscores). In short, abstraction hides complexity, while encapsulation provides data security and controlled access."

By using inheritance, code reusability is achieved because the child class can use the attributes and methods of the parent class without rewriting them. It also supports hierarchical classification and makes programs easier to maintain and extend. In OOP, inheritance represents an “is-a” relationship between classes."
