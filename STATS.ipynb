        "ANS- Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics differ mainly in their purpose and scope of analysis. Descriptive statistics are used to organize, summarize, and present data in a meaningful way, without drawing conclusions beyond the given data. They describe what the data shows using measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation, tables, graphs, and charts. For example, calculating the average marks of a class and displaying them using a bar chart is descriptive statistics, as it only summarizes the existing data. In contrast, inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions, make predictions, or generalize results about a population based on a sample of data. It involves probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, correlation, and regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, using the marks of a sample of students to predict the average performance of all students in a university is inferential statistics. Thus, descriptive statistics describe data, while inferential statistics help in decision-making and prediction beyond the observed data."

        "ANS-   Sampling in statistics is the process of selecting a subset (sample) of individuals, items, or observations from a larger group (population) to study and analyze, so that conclusions about the population can be drawn efficiently and economically. Instead of collecting data from every member of the population, sampling saves time, cost, and effort while still providing reliable results when done properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, surveying 200 voters out of a city of 20,000 voters to understand voting preferences is sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random sampling and stratified sampling differ in how the sample is selected. In random sampling, every member of the population has an equal and independent chance of being selected, and selection is made purely by chance, such as using a lottery method or random number table. For example, randomly choosing 50 students from a college register is random sampling. In stratified sampling, the population is first divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata (such as age groups, gender, or departments), and then samples are randomly selected from each stratum in proportion to their size.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, selecting students separately from first-year, second-year, and third-year classes ensures proper representation. Thus, random sampling ensures simplicity and fairness, while stratified sampling improves accuracy by representing all important subgroups of the population."

        "\n",
        "ANS- Mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency used to represent a large set of data by a single typical value. The mean is defined as the arithmetic average of all observations and is calculated by dividing the sum of all values by the number of observations; for example, the mean of 2, 4, and 6 is (2+4+6)/3 = 4. The median is the middle value of a data set when the observations are arranged in ascending or descending order; for example, for the data 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, the median is 7. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set; for example, in the data 2, 4, 4, 6, and 8, the mode is 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "These measures of central tendency are important because they help in summarizing and understanding large volumes of data in a simple and meaningful way. The mean is widely used in calculations and comparisons, the median is useful when data contains extreme values as it is not affected by outliers, and the mode is helpful in identifying the most common or popular value, especially in categorical data. Together, they provide a clear picture of the data’s central behavior and support effective analysis and decision-making."

        "ANS- Skewness and kurtosis are statistical measures used to describe the shape of a data distribution. Skewness refers to the degree of asymmetry of a distribution around its mean. A distribution is said to be symmetrical if the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images of each other. When the distribution has a longer tail on the right side, it is called positive skewness, and when it has a longer tail on the left side, it is called negative skewness. For example, income distribution is usually positively skewed, where most people earn moderate incomes but a few earn very high incomes.\n",

        "Kurtosis refers to the degree of peakedness or flatness of a distribution compared to a normal distribution. A distribution may be leptokurtic (highly peaked), mesokurtic (normal peak), or platykurtic (flatter than normal). For example, a distribution with many values close to the mean and heavy tails is leptokurtic.\n",
        "\n",
        "A positive skew implies that most of the data values are concentrated on the lower side of the distribution, with a few extremely high values stretching the tail to the right. In such cases, the mean is greater than the median, and the median is greater than the mode (Mean > Median > Mode)."

Covariance helps determine the direction of the relationship between the two variables.

However, covariance does not indicate the strength of the relationship. To measure both the strength and direction, correlation is used. The correlation coefficient ranges from –1 to +1, where values close to +1 indicate a strong positive relationship, values close to –1 indicate a strong negative relationship, and values near 0 indicate little or no linear relationship. Together, these measures help the marketing team understand whether increasing advertising spend is likely to increase daily sales."
