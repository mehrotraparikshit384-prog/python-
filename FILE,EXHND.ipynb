        "ANS - Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, which makes debugging easier but slows execution. Compiled languages first convert the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance. Interpreted languages do not require a separate compilation step, while compiled languages need a compiler. Errors in interpreted languages are detected at runtime, whereas compiled languages detect errors during compilation. For example, Python is an interpreted language, while C is a compiled language."
